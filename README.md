# Climate Controller

## A climate controller which utilizes Reinforcement Learning on Thermodynamic parameters to attain required setpoint for humidity and temperature.

This controller is faster than a PID or a Fuzzy Controller once it learns the dynamics of a room.

Can be used for controlling storage temperatures, transportation of temperature sensitive goods, room climate controller.
