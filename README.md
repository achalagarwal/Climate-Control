#A climate controller which utilizes Reinforcement Learning on Thermodynamic parameters to attain required setpoint for #humidity and temperature.

This controller is faster than a PID or a Fuzzy Controller as it has learnt the dynamics of room.

Can be used for controlling storage temperatures, transportantion of goods, room climate controller.
